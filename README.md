# AST3310 - Astrophysical Plasma and Stellar Interiors

These three projects contains code for simulating the stellar interior of a star. Each project folder contains also the final report that was written for the project.

Project 1: This project involves calculating the energy production at the center of a star given a temperature and density.

Project 2: We model the central parts of a Sun-like
star, including both radiative and convective energy transport. We use the code form project 1 for calculating the energy production in the star.

Project 3: We model convection in 2 dimensions by writing a 2D
hydrodynamics code, implementing the continuity equation with no sources
or sinks, the momentum equation for both x and y, excluding the viscous
stress tensor but including gravity and the energy equation.
